- I am a junior at Del Norte High School, and am deeply interested in aeronautical/astronautical engineering and astrophysics.
- I have been playing soccer for over 9 years and currently play for SDSC Surf here in San Diego. 
- A few clubs I am involved in include the Del Norte California Scholarship Foundation (CSF), DNHS Model United Nations, and the   DNHS Astronomer's Alliance.
- I also enjoy bot development, spending time with my family, and watching soccer games.

- (#) in line #7 for Makefile to fix `bundle install` not running.
- Error `mdless not found` during Linux Shell setup for last code cell. Ran `gem install mdless` in VSCode terminal to fix the issue.

## Important resources to enhance your coding experience:
- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
